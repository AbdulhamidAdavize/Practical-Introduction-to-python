"""Our number system is called base 10 because we have ten digits: 0, 1, . . . , 9. Some cultures,
including the Mayans and Celts, used a base 20 system. In one version of this system, the 20
digits are represented by the letters A through T. Here is a table showing a few conversions:
10 20 10 20 10 20 10 20
0 A 8 I 16 Q 39 BT
1 B 9 J 17 R 40 CA
2 C 10 K 18 S 41 CB
3 D 11 L 19 T 60 DA
4 E 12 M 20 BA 399 TT
5 F 13 N 21 BB 400 BAA
6 G 14 O 22 BC 401 BAB
7 H 15 P 23 BD 402 BAC
Write a function called base20 that converts a base 10 number to base 20. It should return
the result as a string of base 20 digits. One way to convert is to find the remainder when
the number is divided by 20, then divide the number by 20, and repeat the process until the
number is 0. The remainders are the base 20 digits in reverse order, though you have to
convert them into their letter equivalents.
