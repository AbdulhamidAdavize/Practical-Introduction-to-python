Write a program that asks the user to enter a sentence and
 then randomly rearranges the words of the sentence.
 Donâ€™t worry about getting punctuation or capitalization correct.

 b) Do the above problem, but now make sure that the sentence starts with a capital, that
the original first word is not capitalized if it comes in the middle of the sentence, and
that the period is in the right place.
